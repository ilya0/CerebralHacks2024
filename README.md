## Inspiration
The inspiration for C.H.A.R.M. comes from the need for people to practice conversational skills in various contexts—whether it’s navigating romantic conversations, preparing for a date, or practicing interviews. Many people struggle with anxiety or awkwardness in these situations, and we wanted to create an AI tool that could simulate realistic scenarios to help users improve their social and communication skills. Also, many people struggle with the challenge of quality connected interactions, leading to success in dating, interviewing and conflict resolution. Many dating applications, strictly surface level characteristics and focus on quantity of connections, leaving the users unempowered and unable to have any meaningful socializations.

## What it does
C.H.A.R.M. is an AI powered coaching app designed to simulate conversations in social situations such as with a romantic interest, an online encounter or an talking to an interviewer. Users interact with the app as if they are directly texting a potential romantic partner or practicing an interview. The AI adapts to various conversational scenarios, cultural norms or locations, offering real-time feedback and tips on how to improve communication, ask engaging questions, and respond effectively. It serves as both a training tool for dating and social interaction and a professional development tool for interview preparation.

## How we built it
We built C.H.A.R.M. using Google Gemini, training the AI to take on different roles—such as a romantic interest or an interviewer—while simultaneously offering coaching and feedback. The AI operates in a first-person perspective to make the conversation feel as natural as possible. While the current version focuses on text-based interactions, we’ve laid the groundwork to expand into voice and video in the future. The app is powered by Google Gemini's conversational capabilities and uses Firebase for real-time data and user management, with React.js providing the front-end experience.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges was training the AI to effectively switch between its dual roles as a conversational partner and a coach, without breaking the immersion. Ensuring that conversations felt natural and engaging while providing valuable feedback was difficult to balance. Another challenge was designing the app to accommodate various types of conversations, such as casual romantic texts versus more structured interview practice. Creating a UI that felt intuitive, seamless and familiar, while creating a frictionless way to step into the practice of having a social encounter without feeling like they are talking to a chatbot was a huge challenge we had to overcome

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a system that smoothly transitions between coaching and conversation in different contexts. C.H.A.R.M.’s ability to simulate not just romantic conversations but also professional interview settings makes it a versatile tool. Additionally, building a user-friendly interface that feels intuitive and responsive was a significant accomplishment, as was laying the groundwork for future voice and video functionality. We are also proud of how seamless the Ui and conversation is, which allows users to really feel like they are talking to a prospective date or employer.

## What we learned
We learned that maintaining a natural flow in AI-driven conversations while injecting coaching feedback is a delicate balance. Training the AI to offer advice without disrupting the user experience was a valuable lesson. We also gained insights into building scalable AI solutions that can serve multiple purposes, from social interaction practice to professional interview training.

## What's next for C.H.A.R.M.
Moving forward, we plan to expand C.H.A.R.M. into new areas, including dating coaching, fitness coaching, and interview preparation services. We also aim to offer follow-up products such as books, training programs, meetups, and events. Additionally, we will explore partnerships with experts in personal development to provide users with holistic growth opportunities, whether in their personal or professional lives. Expanding to voice and video interactions, as well as adding gamified elements like social challenges, are also on our roadmap.
